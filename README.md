## How these badges work
- The repo badges (stars, forks, issues, last commit) use shields.io endpoints that query GitHub and update automatically.
- Language-composition badges here are static badges constructed from the percentages you provided. If you want them computed live, I can add a tiny action or script to fetch language percentages from the GitHub API and render badges dynamically.
- Play-by-play metric badges (retrieval accuracy, energy reduction, searches) are presented as evidence of impact — change the numbers directly in the README when you update metrics, or ask me to wire them to a JSON file the README reads via a static-hosted image generator.

---

## How to install this on your GitHub profile
1. Create a new repo named exactly: Ashokkumar3006 (or use your username).
2. Add this README.md (replace any placeholder links if needed).
3. Commit & push — the README will appear on your GitHub profile automatically.

---

## Want more?
I can:
- Convert the language badges to be computed live (via a GitHub Action that updates a JSON or an SVG badge).
- Add screenshot/GIF previews for each repo and a hover-activated animated banner.
- Produce alternate color themes for badges and stats cards to match your personal brand.

Tell me which of the enhancements above you want (live badges via Action, GIF previews, or custom color theme), and I’ll generate the files and the GitHub Action workflow to automate it.
